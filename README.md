# Cinemapedia
![Cinemapedia.](./Cine.jpg)


Cinemapedia is a Flutter App that I was doing following Fernando Herrera course's. 
I started this App in my Dart-Flutter Repo but over time I realized that it should have a individual repo due to the dimensions of the App.
I left pending to improve the App following the 18th section of the course. (I have to advance because I want to finish to be able to start with my TFG)

To run the project it is necessary to have Android Studio with a simulator or a mobile phone configured to launch que Flutter App. If there are more doubts I left some links on Dart-Flutter README Repo.
